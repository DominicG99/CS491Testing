# Authentication-Secrets

The following project is for CS491 Final Project.

Within this repository, I took an existing project which allowed users to sign up and login and added testing to it. After logging in, users were then able to "submit" secrets which other users could see. (Sort of like an anonymous message board)

For the testing, I implemented 13 tests, including two integration tests. I tested the main page, login page, register page, register post, login post, delete user, logout, secrets page, submit page and two integration tests. The integration tests tested the login and register units together and the login and submit units together.
